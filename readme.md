This is the first attempt to create a code which would be detecting human bodies on images.

This attempt uses Haar Cascade Classifier. The results are not satisfying me and my team.
File 'OpenCV_haarcascade.py' is ready to implement on server as script for detecting human bodies.
File 'OpenCV_findBestSettingComparison.py' is a script for comaring different settings and choosing one
best setting for each image. Those images are located in 'test_images' folder.

TO RUN THOSE FILES YOU NEED TO INSTALL 'OpenCV' library into you Your enviroment, and You need to have
Haar Cascade Classifier for fullbody representation located into folder with script while compiling.

The secound attempt will provide deep learning functions for improving detection results.

Thank you for reading this file.
